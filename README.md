# Bard Walk

## Description

This is a simple point-n-click style game about a bard waking up and enjoying
life as he heads into a small town. As you walk, you will see beautiful sights
that can be recorded in your adventurer's notebook. Be careful though; space and
time are limited.

### Week 1
I am currently working two
jobs in unskilled capacities, and I can't stand it. The work does not really
stimulate the problem solving or the artistic parts of my mind. Every day that I
go in to work, I feel frustrated at the fact that I can not be doing something
more creative with that time.

That brings me to this week. I looked at the onegameamonth.com website for some
inspiration. The theme for this month is "write." So I decided to make this game,
Bard Walk, give the players a taste of writing - of why it's important, at least
to me. The way I see it, writing is a way of telling our descendants what is
important - what *really* matters in life. Figuring out how to put this not in
words, but a game, is difficult.

First, you have to give people a way to record. Typing is an option, but I want
this game to be mobile friendly (typing is not fun on mobile). My current idea
is a tap-and-hold approach, where tapping on something and staying there will
eventually pick it up as an icon that you can put into a virtual notebook. Icons
are not an exact match for language, but I think that they can be a good enough
substitute in this case.
